\section{Question 1}
For n = 2 and m = 3, the number of different resolute voting rules that are strategyproof can be obtained by querying the length of the list $l\_ex1$ produced by the following:
\begin{lstlisting}
cnf_ex1 = ( cnfAtLeastOne() + cnfResolute() + cnfStrategyProof() )
l_ex1 = list( itersolve( cnf_ex1 ) )
\end{lstlisting}
There are 17 rules satisfying these two axioms. If we analyze the elements of the list we are able to give a descriptions of such rules.
